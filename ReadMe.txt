Notes about project:
Depends on javax.mail as well as Google's calender API. On first attempt google will give you a security warning. 

Google's calender API is installed but not used do to time conastraints in development

Starting this project I had never attempted to interface with gmail via java. Now that im done with the project I've learned to use javax.mail libaray and found that google has an API specify for calender events.
